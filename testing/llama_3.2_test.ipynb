      "Making pasta pesto with chicken is a great idea. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "* 2 cups fresh basil leaves\n",
      "* 1/3 cup pine nuts (or walnuts)\n",
      "* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n",
      "* 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil\n",
      "* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "* Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "* 8 ounces pasta of your choice (e.g., linguine, fettuccine, or spaghetti)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the chicken**: In a small bowl, whisk together chicken pieces, salt, and pepper.\n",
      "2. **Cook the chicken**: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.\n",
      "3. **Make the pesto sauce**: In a food processor or blender, combine basil leaves, pine nuts, garlic, and Parmesan cheese. Process until well combined and slightly smooth.\n",
      "4. **Add olive oil**: With the processor running, slowly pour in olive oil through the top. Process until the pesto sauce reaches your desired consistency.\n",
      "5. **Combine chicken and pesto**: Add cooked chicken back into the processor with the pesto sauce. Process until everything is well combined.\n",
      "6. **Toss with pasta**: Add cooked pasta to the processor and toss everything together until the pasta is well coated with the pesto sauce.\n",
      "7. **Serve**: Divide the pasta among plates, garnish with additional basil leaves if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use high-quality ingredients, including fresh basil and good-quality Parmesan cheese.\n",
      "* Don't overprocess the pesto sauce, as it can become too thin and lose its texture.\n",
      "* Adjust the amount of garlic to your taste. Some people prefer a stronger garlic flavor, while others prefer a more subtle hint.\n",
      "* You can also add other ingredients to customize the pesto sauce to your liking, such as cherry tomatoes or sun-dried peppers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your delicious pasta pesto with chicken!\n"
